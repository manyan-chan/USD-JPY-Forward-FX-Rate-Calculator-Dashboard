A web application built with Streamlit to calculate the theoretical USD/JPY forward foreign exchange rate based on the current spot rate and the relevant interest rates for USD and JPY. It also visualizes the forward rate curve across standard tenors.

## Features

*   **Specific Date Calculation:** Calculate the forward rate, forward points (scaled by 100), and the number of days for a specific user-defined value date and forward settlement date.
*   **Formula Display:** Shows the formula used for the calculation with the user's input values.
*   **Forward Curve Visualization:** Generates and displays an interactive forward rate curve using Plotly for standard tenors (1W, 1M, 2M, 3M, 6M, 9M, 1Y, 2Y).
*   **Data Table:** Presents the data points used for the forward curve (Tenor, Settlement Date, Days, Forward Rate, Forward Points) in a clear table format.
*   **User-Friendly Inputs:** Easy-to-use inputs for spot rate, interest rates (USD & JPY), value date, forward date, and day count basis (360/365).
*   **Date Handling:** Uses `datetime` and `dateutil.relativedelta` for robust date calculations, including standard tenor adjustments.

## How it Works

The application calculates the theoretical forward rate using the standard interest rate parity formula (adjusted for day count conventions):

```
Forward Rate = Spot Rate * [(1 + Quote Currency Rate * (Days / Day Basis)) / (1 + Base Currency Rate * (Days / Day Basis))]
```

Where:
*   **Spot Rate:** The current exchange rate (USD/JPY).
*   **Quote Currency Rate:** The interest rate for the quote currency (JPY).
*   **Base Currency Rate:** The interest rate for the base currency (USD).
*   **Days:** The number of days between the value date (spot settlement) and the forward settlement date.
*   **Day Basis:** The day count convention used for annualizing interest rates (typically 360 or 365).

Forward points are calculated as `(Forward Rate - Spot Rate) * 100` (common convention for JPY pairs).

The forward curve is generated by applying this calculation iteratively for standard market tenors relative to the value date.

## Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the script):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/manyan-chan/USD-JPY-Forward-FX-Rate-Calculator-Dashboard.git
    cd USD-JPY-Forward-FX-Rate-Calculator-Dashboard
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit pandas plotly python-dateutil
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Run the Streamlit application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2.  **Open your web browser:** Streamlit will typically open the app automatically, or provide a local URL (like `http://localhost:8501`).

3.  **Interact with the app:**
    *   Adjust the input values (Spot Rate, Interest Rates, Dates, Day Basis) in the sidebar/main panel.
    *   The calculated forward rate for the specific date and the forward curve chart/table will update automatically based on your inputs.

## Dependencies

*   [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/): For creating the web application interface.
*   [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): For data manipulation and creating DataFrames.
*   [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/): For creating interactive charts.
*   [python-dateutil](https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): For robust relative date calculations (e.g., adding months/years).

## Disclaimer

This calculator provides **theoretical** forward rates based on the provided inputs and a standard formula. Actual market forward rates can differ significantly due to various factors including, but not limited to:

*   Market liquidity and depth
*   Bid/ask spreads
*   Counterparty credit risk premiums
*   Transaction costs
*   Specific bank quoting conventions and funding costs
*   Differences between deposit/borrowing rates (like SOFR, TONA, LIBOR, Euribor) used in the market vs. the generic rates input here.
